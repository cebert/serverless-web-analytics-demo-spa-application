         This is a simple Angular SPA application that uses utilizes Serverless
         Website Analytics SDK Client to ingest logs into Serverless Website
         Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
         Using the SDK Client is not strictly necessary. You can ingest data
         into Serverless Website Analytics one of the following ways:
      </p>

      <ol>
         <li>Import Script</li>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Add an import script to the site's HTML load ingestion code.
            </li>
            <li>
               When the attribute tracking option is enabled, only buttons and
               links with the <code>swa-event</code> attribute are tracked.
            </li>
         </ul>
         <li>SDK Client</li>
         <ul>
            <li>
               Import SDK Client package for more control over event
               publication. This approach works better for SPA applications with
               complex routing.

         </ul>
      </ol>
      <h2>What is Serverless Analytics?</h2>
      <p>
         Serverless analytics is a method of collecting and analyzing data
         without managing any infrastructure. It leverages serverless
         technologies such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB to provide
         scalable, cost-effective analytics solutions. This approach allows
         developers to focus on building features rather than managing servers.
